			<h2>Personal Information</h2>
			<img id="portrait" src="michael-plenert-headshot.jpg" alt="Picture of Michael Plenert">
			<br>
			<p>I am a Canadian citizen who moved to Australia almost three years ago, after my Aussie wife took me for hostage.  We’ve now made the beautiful Central coast of NSW our home by swapping snow with sand, and I’m enjoying the lifestyle.</p>
			<p>Born and raised in Vancouver,. My father is Mennonite; with a distant family that can be traced all over Europe.  My mother is ethnically Chinese, but she moved from Hong Kong to Canada when she was a child.</p>
			<p>I speak French as a second language (a little rusty), and this degree will be my first post-secondary education if you don’t include certificates. I hold a current Cisco CCENT certificate and I plan of taking my ICND2 this coming March.</p>
			<p> A little-known fact about me is that in my twenties I purchased and modified a deep crawler and ran a news search engine website that collected and categorized articles from just under two thousand newspapers from around the world. I love to draw (but not paint because I'm severly colour weak), take photographs and tinker with my Raspberry Pi’s and HP DL380 G7 server running vCenter.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="interest">
			<br><br>
			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<br>
			<p>While I’m not sure when my interest in IT started, I began taking computers apart when I was 12 years old, after blowing up my parent’s monitor trying get around Chuck Yeager’s Flight Simulator anti-piracy system (each time the game kicked me out, it would degauss the monitor). My Father took me down to a used computer store to replace the monitor and that’s when I became hooked on upgrading computers. Over the next eight years I built tens of computers for friends and family and formatted my poor parent’s computer countless times eventually leading to my first job in IT in 2001. I’ve now worked as a computer tech for over fifteen years.</p>
			<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
			<p>A few years into my IT job I started listening to Podcasts whenever I was working nights. My favorite Podcasts were open university courses and I love their mission so when I decided to go back to school my first thought was to look for an open university.</p>
			<h3>Educational Expectations</h3>
			<p>About two years ago when I started my tech business, I was aiming to support small businesses on the Central Coast in NSW, but I find myself supporting individuals instead which means for every hour I spend working, I spend an hour driving. Since I’m not a fan of traffic, I’ve been keen to move into other fields of IT, specifically DevOps or back end web or app development. Through this degree I’m hoping to get some direction and thorough understanding of what it’s like to work with different types of code and areas of IT, and I hope having the degree will help me obtain a position in that field.</p>

			<h2>Ideal Job: DevOps Lead - AWS</h2>
			<h3 class="refLink"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39244686?searchrequesttoken=e34579d4-8f4f-40d6-8ef2-91f07edd18e8&type=standout">https://www.seek.com.au/job/39244686?searchrequesttoken=e34579d4-8f4f-40d6-8ef2-91f07edd18e8&type=standout</a></h3>
			<a href="job-post.png" id="job-post" target="_blank"><img src="job-post-thumbnail.gif" alt="A thumbnail image of a job listing on www.seek.com.au"></a>
			<p>Design, Build, Manage and Maintain applications on premise and in the cloud using DevOps to collect, monitor and analyze data in order to help the client get ahead of issues and provide quick response turnaround and fixes. It’s extremely rewarding to work on a project that you can go on to support and maintain into the future while at the same time can rollover what you’ve learnt and apply it to the next project.</p>
			<p>To get a position like this you’d need years of management, AWS certifications, some previous work with CICD methodology; maybe some work with Jenkins Pipeline. A solid understanding with infrastructure on Layer 2 and Layer 3 would probably be required.  My understanding is that most DevOps positions are filled with people who come from a background in coding. Good work ethic and a willingness to put in the hours.</p>
			<p>My fifteen years as a computer tech working on desktops and servers would come in handy as would my Cisco certificate on routing and switching. Beyond that I have also done some work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and run ISPConfig on a Debian Linux ESXi 6 virtual machine.</p>
			<p>There is a lot of experience and study that stands between where I am today and this dream job. Though I’ve been a team lead on many projects, the scope has been smaller, and the timelines have been much shorter so I would need to take a course or get some practical experience in management. Security is always at the top of my mind and with any new technology comes a new world of security. This job is close to a full stack developer and I would need to be aware of best practices and have practical experience on every level. While I have investigated AWS, I would need to get a certificate or two in order to feel comfortable. And finally, I would need to build a program or app from the ground up probably in Python.</p>

			<h2>Psych Tests</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The following results reinforce my need to stay ahead in my work, stay on task and make sure that to finish what I start within deadlines. I should also be tidier and force myself to be a little more outgoing. Looking at this data encourages me to  work on being a better teammate, especially in how quickly I respond to others, while being mindful that I must juggle not only the work but also coordinate with the team’s work. During the team formation process it would be wise for me to look for someone who is good at monitoring the peripherals and milestones.</p>

			<h2>Project:<br>Parental-Control with Modern Tech</h2>
			<br>
			<p>My vision is for a future where children can go anywhere on the internet because any questionable and inapropriate content, including comments and images will be redacted, and I think this scenario is possible using current technologies. Your child’s ability to get online is essential and it’s important to find a real solution to this problem.</p>
			<p>Parental-control apps have never been able to beat motivated preteens and while most can recognize that children aren’t mature enough to navigate the internet unsupervised, it’s unsettling how intrusive parental-control software really is. That parents feel the need to use these tools proves to me that there is an important and interesting opportunity for a new product to enter this crowded market. With machine learning tools, data scrapers, and distributed computing, technology can finally strike a balance between allowing children freedom to wander the internet while protecting them from inappropriate content through dynamically redacting text, images, and videos.</p>
			<p>My motivation is primarily drawn from current events and family. For years my sister has been frustrated with the way her son uses his superior computer knowledge to undermine his parents. She has found and closed multiple paypal, email and facebook accounts over the years starting from when he was six. Recently there has been a lot of media attention focusing on cyberbullying, online hate speech, disinformation and toxic tribalism. Governments have severly critisized Facebook for years over their privacy policy and disinformation and now even more worrysome are child predaters infiltrating the comment sections on YouTube and eveny creating content.</p>
			<p>A quick google search will find a few parental-control apps come to the top like in this article from PCMAG <cite>(Rubenking & Moore , 2019)</cite>. I’ve chosen <a href="https://www.qustodio.com/en/">Qustodio</a> as my benchmark. If you venture to the comment section of many YouTube reviews of this product (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci9GUAmxMk0" target="_blank">link1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqrr7nCQqGs" target="_blank">link2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFm80kxoiHA" target="_blank">link3</a>), you’ll notice that on the one hand children find this app too restrictive and they actively share information, or circumvent how to disable or circumvent it while on the other hand parents are singing it’s praises about the control they can exert over their childrens internet use.
			When you see the extent to which children dislike this experience and when you know how easy it is to get around this program, it should be obvious that there needs to be a better option.</p>
			<p>Imagine creating a standard Windows account for your child, then logging in and executing a launcher that will install a virtual machine taking you to a short set up page. As the child logs on to the account, the virtual machine will immidiately launch and greet the child with Linux and an entire suite of tools to explore. As the child navigates through the internet they are completely free to go anywhere but may not be able to view certain text, images or videos while on a webpage. Social media websites are now available to visit, but they might not be able to view all the content, participate in certain discussions or sign up with the wrong age.</p>
			<p>In this scenario the limits are more subtle, and you aren’t hiding from anyone; no parent has any reason to look over your shoulder. Internet speeds are always increasing and more threads are always being added to processors to where we have extra margin to use and we can now simulate a great user experience that can satisfy every child’s curiosity while keeping them safe.</p>
			<p>The last point I’ll touch on has to do with fostering a good relationship with your child. It’s well documented as this article form wiley.com <cite>(Hawk, S., Becht, A. and Branje, S.)</cite> shows that snooping on a child has a negative effect on the family dynamic and studies show it can lead to a breakdown in communication and can leave a lasting impression on the psyche of a child. Reading comments from a reddit post that I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2o5k3s/qustodio_the_ultimate_narc_online_stalking_tool/">here</a>, you can clearly see that the intended effect of this software has been lost and the conversations have turned to invasion of privacy. Some are even looking for laws that can protect their privacy. There is a complete collapse of trust between these teens and their parents. My research so far has suggested that child care professionals, parents and caregivers would all agree that it is important to develope a good relationship with your child not just for your own sake, but for the healthy development of your child. Paraphrased from acpeds.org <cite>(Veritas, D.)</cite>.</p>
			<p>In a perfect world, the install package would include a virtual machine that could record snapshot backups. The image would be a forked distro of Debian focused on the freedom to go anywhere and the program would be baked into the distro. During the installation process, there could be a short questionnaire for filtering-based pre-sets. The application would run between the network card and the browser and a lightweight crawler would be used to speed up browsing. The system would redact inappropriate content before displaying the page. This would allow every page on every site to be viewable. CXXNET <cite>(Information found on Butler Analytics.)</cite> deep learning tool could flag suspicious content and anything not recognized could be sent to AWS to be tested against similar content in a database and redacted if necessary.</p>
			<p>The obstacles would be relying on an open source community which could lead to delays and the cost of developers write and maintain the distro and software and push security patches and updates. The up front cost could be large as we would need to rent space with AWS so we can build our machine learning. We would need a programmer for the crawler and we would have to license a virtual machine from a company like <a href="www.vmware.com">VMWare</a>. The annual price might be too high for what the consumer gets. This also doesn’t address mobile devices, which make up a significant percentage of the market. There are also challenges this type of software faces. The software needs to be self-explanatory on why it’s useful to the child.</p>
			<p>This software has to walk the fine line between removing content while not feeling overbearing, because there is nothing you can do to your PC that can stop a child from <span id="block">installing Linux on to a thumb drive, popping the CMOS battery if you protected the BIOS, booting off the USB and installing a VPN</span> which would leave them unprotected.</p>
