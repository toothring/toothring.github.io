			<h3>Personal Information</h3>
			<p>I am a Canadian citizen who is currently immigrating to Australia to live with my wife close to her parents. My father is Mennonite; his family can be traced all over Europe and my mother is ethnically Chinese, but she moved from Hong Kong to Canada when she was a child.</p>
			<p>Born and raised in Vancouver, my wife and I relocated to the Central Coast almost three years ago. I speak English and French (a little rusty) and this degree will be my first post-secondary education if you don’t include certificates. I do hold a current Cisco CCENT certificate and I plan of taking my ICND2 this coming March</p>
			<p> A little-known fact about me is that in my twenties I purchased and modified a deep crawler and ran a news search engine website that collected and categorized articles from just under two thousand newspapers from around the world. I love to draw, take photographs and tinker with my Raspberry Pi’s and HP DL380 G7 server running vCenter.</p>
