			<h2>Personal Information</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I am a Canadian citizen who moved to Australia almost three years ago, after my Aussie wife took me for hostage.  We’ve now made the beautiful Central coast of NSW our home by swapping snow with sand, and I’m enjoying the lifestyle.</p>
			<p>Born and raised in Vancouver,. My father is Mennonite; with a distant family that can be traced all over Europe.  My mother is ethnically Chinese, but she moved from Hong Kong to Canada when she was a child.</p>
			<p>I speak French as a second language (a little rusty), and this degree will be my first post-secondary education if you don’t include certificates. I hold a current Cisco CCENT certificate and I plan of taking my ICND2 this coming March.</p>
			<p> A little-known fact about me is that in my twenties I purchased and modified a deep crawler and ran a news search engine website that collected and categorized articles from just under two thousand newspapers from around the world. I love to draw (but not paint because I'm severly colour weak), take photographs and tinker with my Raspberry Pi’s and HP DL380 G7 server running vCenter.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="interest">
			<br><br>
			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<br>
			<p>While I’m not sure when my interest in IT started, I began taking computers apart when I was 12 years old, after blowing up my parent’s monitor trying get around Chuck Yeager’s Flight Simulator anti-piracy system (each time the game kicked me out, it would degauss the monitor). My Father took me down to a used computer store to replace the monitor and that’s when I became hooked on upgrading computers. Over the next eight years I built tens of computers for friends and family and formatted my poor parent’s computer countless times eventually leading to my first job in IT in 2001. I’ve now worked as a computer tech for over fifteen years.</p>
			<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
			<p>A few years into my IT job I started listening to Podcasts whenever I was working nights. My favorite Podcasts were open university courses and I love their mission so when I decided to go back to school my first thought was to look for an open university.</p>
			<h3>Educational Expectations</h3>
			<p>About two years ago when I started my tech business, I was aiming to support small businesses on the Central Coast in NSW, but I find myself supporting individuals instead which means for every hour I spend working, I spend an hour driving. Since I’m not a fan of traffic, I’ve been keen to move into other fields of IT, specifically DevOps or back end web or app development. Through this degree I’m hoping to get some direction and thorough understanding of what it’s like to work with different types of code and areas of IT, and I hope having the degree will help me obtain a position in that field.</p>

			<h2>Ideal Job: DevOps Lead - AWS</h2>
			<h3 class="refLink"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39244686?searchrequesttoken=e34579d4-8f4f-40d6-8ef2-91f07edd18e8&type=standout">https://www.seek.com.au/job/39244686?searchrequesttoken=e34579d4-8f4f-40d6-8ef2-91f07edd18e8&type=standout</a></h3>
			<a href="job-post.png" id="job-post" target="_blank"><img src="job-post-thumbnail.gif" alt="A thumbnail image of a job listing on www.seek.com.au"></a>
			<p>Design, Build, Manage and Maintain applications on premise and in the cloud using DevOps to collect, monitor and analyze data in order to help the client get ahead of issues and provide quick response turnaround and fixes. It’s extremely rewarding to work on a project that you can go on to support and maintain into the future while at the same time can rollover what you’ve learnt and apply it to the next project.</p>
			<p>To get a position like this you’d need years of management, AWS certifications, some previous work with CICD methodology; maybe some work with Jenkins Pipeline. A solid understanding with infrastructure on Layer 2 and Layer 3 would probably be required.  My understanding is that most DevOps positions are filled with people who come from a background in coding. Good work ethic and a willingness to put in the hours.</p>
			<p>My fifteen years as a computer tech working on desktops and servers would come in handy as would my Cisco certificate on routing and switching. Beyond that I have also done some work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and run ISPConfig on a Debian Linux ESXi 6 virtual machine.</p>
			<p>There is a lot of experience and study that stands between where I am today and this dream job. Though I’ve been a team lead on many projects, the scope has been smaller, and the timelines have been much shorter so I would need to take a course or get some practical experience in management. Security is always at the top of my mind and with any new technology comes a new world of security. This job is close to a full stack developer and I would need to be aware of best practices and have practical experience on every level. While I have investigated AWS, I would need to get a certificate or two in order to feel comfortable. And finally, I would need to build a program or app from the ground up probably in Python.</p>

			<h2>Psych Tests</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The following results reinforce my need to stay ahead in my work, stay on task and make sure that to finish what I start within deadlines. I should also be tidier and force myself to be a little more outgoing. Looking at this data encourages me to  work on being a better teammate, especially in how quickly I respond to others, while being mindful that I must juggle not only the work but also coordinate with the team’s work. During the team formation process it would be wise for me to look for someone who is good at monitoring the peripherals and milestones.</p>

			<h2>Project:<br>Parental-Control with Modern Tech</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Parental-control apps have never been able to beat motivated preteens and while most can recognize that kids aren’t mature enough to navigate the internet unsupervised, it’s unsettling how intrusive parental-control software really is. That parents feel the need to use these tools proves to me that there is an important and interesting opportunity for a new product to enter this crowded market. I feel that machine learning tools working behind crawling tools and utilizing distributed computing, technology might finally be able to find a balance through allowing curious minds to wander while dynamically redacting not only text, but image and video content to keep them safe as they surf with their privacy intact.</p>
			<p>My motivation is primarily based on current events and family. My sister has been frustrated for years because her son has taken advantage of the fact that his parents know relatively little about computers. Whenever I visit my sister, she tells me how her son disabled everything, got in to everywhere and has been watching who-knows-what. Lately there’s also been quite a bit of news about how there’s so much user generated content that’s bullying, or hate speech, disinformation or just toxic tribalism. Facebook has made news for a while now, but the comment section of YouTube videos aimed at children is a little more worrying.</p>
			<p>Imagine creating a standard access Windows account for your child and installing a program that cripples the user account and installs a virtual machine akin to XP Mode for Windows 7 Pro. The child logs in to Windows but is redirected to a Linux desktop that seemingly has everything they would need to work and explore. As kids surfs the internet, they might see some blacked-out areas where images or videos would normally be or sometimes the odd black line where text should exist, but they are completely free to go anywhere. Every page on social media websites are now available to visit, but they might not be able to view all the content or participate in certain discussions. In this scenario there isn’t a real reason to try and get around the parental controls because the limits are more subtle, and you aren’t hiding from anyone; no parent has any reason to look over your shoulder. Internet speeds are always getting faster and computer processors are always adding more threads to the point where we have extra computing horsepower to spare and we can now simulate a great user experience that can satisfy every child’s curiosity while keeping them safe.</p>
			<p>A quick google search will find a few parental-control apps come to the top and I’ve chosen Qustodio as my benchmark because it receives the highest marks on most <a href="#pcmag">review websites</a>. If you venture to the comment section of many YouTube reviews of this product (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci9GUAmxMk0" target="_blank">link1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqrr7nCQqGs" target="_blank">link2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFm80kxoiHA" target="_blank">link3</a>), you’ll notice that kids find this app too restrictive and they actively share how to disable or circumvent it while parents are signing it’s praises about the control they can exert. When you see how much kids hate the experience and when you know how easy it is to get around this program, it should be obvious that there needs to be a better option.</p>
			<p>The last point I’ll touch on has to do with fostering a good relationship with your child. It’s well documented (example) that snooping on a child does not have a positive effect on the family dynamic and study’s show it can lead to a breakdown in communication and can have lasting negative effects of the psyche of a child. Following this random <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2o5k3s/qustodio_the_ultimate_narc_online_stalking_tool/" target="_blank">reddit post</a> you can clearly see that the intended effect of this software has been lost and the conversations have turned to invasion of privacy and some are even looking for laws that can protect their privacy. There is a complete collapse of trust between these teens and their parents. I don’t thing anyone would disagree on how important it is to have a good relationship with your child not just for your sake but for the development of your child (here).</p>
			<p>In a perfect world, the install package would include a virtual machine that could record snapshot backups. The image would be a forked distro of Debian focused on the freedom to go anywhere and the program would be baked into the distro. A short questionnaire for filtering-based presets. The application would run between the network card and the browser and a light weight crawler would be used to speed up browsing. The system and would redact inappropriate content before displaying the page. This would allow every page on every site to be viewable. <a href="#butler-analytics">CXXNET deep learning tool</a> could flag content and anything not recognized could be sent to AWS to be tested against similar content in a database and redacted if necessary.</p>
			<p>Obstacles would be relying on open source community. Upfront cost could be massive. Annual price might be too high for what you get. This doesn’t address mobile devices, which makes up a significant percentage of the market. Requires basic knowledge of Linux.</p>
			<p>There are challenges this type of software faces. The software needs to be self-explanatory on why it’s useful to the child. If it can’t walk the fine line between removing content while not feeling overbearing, there is nothing that would stop a teen from just installing Linux on to a thumb drive, popping the CMOS battery and loading an OS with a VPN that circumvents anything and everything short of blacklisting the MAC address providing you ever found out what they were doing.</p>
			<p>My vision is for a future where children can go anywhere on the internet because any questionably content, including comments and images can be redacted, and I think this scenario is possible using current technologies. Your child’s ability to get online is essential now a days and it’s important to find a real solution to this problem.</p>
